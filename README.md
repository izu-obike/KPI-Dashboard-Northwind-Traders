<STRONG>Northwind Traders</STRONG>, is a global import and export company that specializes in supplying high-quality gourmet food products to restaurants, cafes, and specialty food retailers around the world.
As part of my job, I'm responsible for creating a high-level KPI dashboard for the Executive team. Its goal is to assist the team in quickly understanding the company's performance in critical areas such as trends, sales performance, pricing, and so on.

<STRONG>Analysis:</STRONG>

Are there any noticeable sales trends over time?

Which are the best and worst-selling products?

Can you identify any key customers?

Are shipping costs consistent across providers?
